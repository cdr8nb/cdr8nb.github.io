    <td>This poster was assigned by the Director of the film, Chip Gubera, for a grade in my 3610 Digital Effects class. I recived a perfect score for capturing the essence of standing up in the wake of a disaster.</td>
    <td>My first animator teacher suggested that I start making animations for competitions so I made one titled POWERS. I had to make some art of my film so I created this poster and used it to promote my film on social media.</td>
    <td>I am curently working with my school's media organization and while we were preparing for Mizzou's Homecoming weekend, I suggested a few posters and videos to promote our TV station, radio show, and newspaper would be covering the game. I had complete creative freedom and this is one of the posters we hung.</td>
    <td>These Games was a fun video I made with my old roomate. I wanted to transition from live action to 2D seamlessly in my film. My roomate did the acting while I did the filming, editing, and animating.</td>
