    <td>For my summer 2018 Digital Effects course, we were assigned to make a poster of advertising for our professor’s film. I took a few days to think how to composite the poster and decided to design it as the film told the story. Before the event, the destruction afterwards, and how people pulled together to rebuild. The American flag on the back was because Missouri is located in the “heart of America.” This lesson taught me the lesson that simple isn’t bad or lazy. I mean, yes, a show of creativity and an overall style is essential but keeping it simple is sometimes the best way to go.</td>
    <td>So, once I started entering films into competitions, I needed posters for them. Just something to capture the eyes of judges so I quickly made this. I was going to spend a few days creating something more elaborate but instead decided to keep it simple. It is a simple two-dimensional animation with a few live action characters so why present it as more or less?</td>
    <td>This graphic was put on social media and television screens around campus to make sure the students knew that Mizzou’s radio station and television channel will host the 2018 homecoming game. Also, that the newspaper would recap the game highlights. Admittedly, there is a lot on this graphic and I should have cut down on a few visuals but loved using the three-dimensional setting in After Effects and adding spotlights and shadowing. In the future I need to understand people walking buy won’t pay more than 8 seconds to a graphic like this and need to design accordingly.</td>
    <td>Immediately after I finished my video for competition I fell asleep on the keyboard and woke up seeing I had copied and pasted 50 pages of the words “These Games.” I thought it was interesting and different so I choose a fun font, color palate, and bolded one “These Games.” I still think it is pretty cool but I should have bumped the size of the bolded “These Games” up a bit because it might not be as noticeable as I thought it was.</td>
