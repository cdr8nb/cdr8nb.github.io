    <td>For my summer 2018 Digital Effects course, we were assigned to make a poster advertising our professor’s film. I took some time and decided to design it as the film told the story: before the event, the destruction afterwards, and how people pulled together to rebuild. I put in an American flag in the background, uner a rough later of brick to symbolize Missouri is in the “heart of America.” The plan was to show creativity and an overall style by keeping the layout simple.</td>
    <td>So, once I started entering films into competitions, I needed posters for them. I Just needed something to capture the eyes of judges, so I quickly made this. I was going to spend a few days creating something more elaborate but instead decided to keep it simple. It is a streamlined two-dimensional animation with live action characters. Why make things complicated?</td>
    <td>This graphic was put on social media and television screens around campus to make sure the students knew that Mizzou’s radio station and television channel will host the 2018 homecoming game. Also, the newspaper would recap the game highlights. Admittedly, I should have cut down on a few visuals but loved using the three-dimensional setting in After Effects which added spotlights and shadow. In the future I need to understand people walking by won’t give more than 8 seconds to a graphic like this and need to design accordingly.</td>
    <td>Immediately after I finished my video for competition I fell asleep on the keyboard and woke up seeing I had copied and pasted 50 pages of the words “These Games.” I thought it was interesting and different, so I chose a fun font, color palate, and made of the the “These Games" bold. I still think it is pretty unique, but I should have bumped the size of the bolded “These Games” up a bit because it might not be as noticeable as I thought it was.</td>
