    <td>This was a fun animation because I was able to animate real drawings to make my video. It was cool incorporating real hand drawn drawings in my animation because it adds a sense of realism. So, we had the art in the class server and cleaned them up on Photoshop. Then we imported them in After Effects for manipulation. It was pretty cool because we learned how the Adobe cloud is so uniform and works so smoothly together. I learned a lot of tricks how to work fast while using multiple programs and how to render faster and how to render with more quality. Since this project, I have been working with another MU artist and am trying to put together a fun animation using her amazing artwork.</td>
    <td>Summer 2018 was an interesting learning experience because I had a stick digital media teacher with a tight, unbending schedule of due dates. I was cranking out videos using After Effects every week, trying my hardest to make quality work I would keep. But for this project, I knew I wanted to put more effort into it. We were told to make a lyrical video for a song so I made one for Montana of 300's "Chiraq." The bass is so powerful, his flow is so amazing, his lyrical genius is out of this world, plus the real music video is shot and edited so creatively I advise all to go <a href=" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4xvmH3WSQ "> check it out </a>.  I spent at least 10 hours getting the beat, I made, and the words to match how he rapped them. This was one of those projects, each time I looked at it, I want to edit it a little more but canâ€™t find the original project file.</td>
    <td>Before the summer of 2018, my animating mentor told me to start storyboarding and animating a longer video for film festivals. I spent weeks and weeks storyboarding, planning, and then coming up with These Games. I decided to make a film that would bleed from live action into a two-dimensional world. I have always thought that would be interesting and it was! This is one of the projects that reassures me digital storytelling is my passion. The filming process was fun and pulling all-nighters animating was draining but such a blast. My girlfriend almost dumped me because of how obsessed I was becoming but I completed and even got two awards. Of course, I look back at the film now and can find 20 thing I could have done differently but I can honestly say creating These Games was one of the best experiences of my college career.</td>
    <td>After completing These Games, I realized I should probably get a professional credit for my resume, as well. I applied for MU's Mizzou Student Media, and got it. I was assigned to make animations for the school's paper, television channel, and promos for the radio show. It was a lot of fun. I loved actually working with a team of people with agendas and creating stuff for them. It was like having clients. So in the fall of 2018 we had to get the word out that MSM would be covering the big game. I was asked to make a logo and animation to convey this message and created this animation. I made a lot of revisions but after a couple days they seemed to like it. I am glad I took that job because even though I wasn't paid, I did learn how to work with a team to promote an event and that is something I never have done before.</td>
