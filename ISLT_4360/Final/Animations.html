    <td>For this animation I was asked to animate actual drawings to make my video. Incorporating hand drawn images into my animation added a sense of realism. I pulled the art from the class server and cleaned them up on Photoshop. Then I imported them in After Effects for manipulation. It was exciting because I learned how the Adobe Cloud is so uniform and the applications works smoothly together.  I learned a lot of tricks such as how to work fast while using multiple programs, how to render faster, and how to render with more quality. Since this project, I have been working with another MU artist and am trying to put together an animation using her amazing artwork.</td>
    <td>For this animation I was challenged to represent a lyrical video for a song.   I chose Montana of 300’s “Chiraq.”   The bass is so powerful.  His flow is so amazing, and his lyrical genius is out of this world.  Plus, the real music video is shot and edited so creatively I advise all to go <a href=" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4xvmH3WSQ "> check it out </a>. I spent at least 10 hours making the beat and getting it to match the lyrics and how he rapped them. This was one of those projects that each time I looked at it, I wanted to edit it a little more toward perfection.</td>
    <td>Before the summer of 2018, my animation mentor told me to start storyboarding and animating a longer video for film festivals. I spent weeks and weeks storyboarding, planning, and then coming up with These Games. I decided to make a film that would bleed from live action into a two-dimensional world. I have always thought that would be interesting and it was! This is one of the projects that reassures me digital storytelling is my passion.  I look back at the film now and can find 20 things I could have done differently but I can honestly say creating These Games was one of the best experiences of my college career.  I am very proud of my awards of acknowledgment from two international film festivals. </td>
    <td>After completing These Games, I realized I should probably get a professional credit for my resume, as well. I applied for MU's Mizzou Student Media (MSM) and got it. I was assigned to make animations for the school's paper and television channel and promos for the radio show.  I loved working with a team of clients with agendas and creating content for them.  In the fall of 2018 we had to get the word out that MSM would be covering the big game. I was asked to make a logo and animation to convey this message and created this animation. It took a lot of time and many revisions but I learned how to work with a team to produce content for a client to promote an event.</td>
