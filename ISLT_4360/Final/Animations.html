    <td>This was a fun animation because I was able to use drawlings to make my video. It was cool incorporating real hand drawn drawlings in my animation. We had the art on our computers and cleaned them up on Photoshop. Then imported them in After Effects for manipulation. I learned a lot of tricks how to work fast while using multiple programs and how a hand drawn imagine always adds a little more character to an animation.</td>
    <td>Summer 2018 was a fun learning experience because I had a strick digital media teacher with a tight, unbending schedule of due dates. I was cranking out videos using After Effects every week. But for this project, I knew I wanted to put more effort into it. We were told to make a lyrical video for a song so I made one for Montana of 300's "Chiraq." The bass was so powerful and his flow was so amaing I spent at least 10 hours getting the words to match how he rapped them. This was one of those projects, each time I looked at it, I want to edit it a little more.</td>
    <td>So before Summer 2018, my animating mentor told me he wanted me to get some longer animations I could start applying to festivals. So I spent weeks and weeks storyboarding, planning, and then coming up with an animation. It couldn't be too much, to the point I'd fall on my face and it would show I'm reaching, but it had to be a learning experience. I decided to make a film that would bleed from live action into a 2 demensional world. And it was fun! The filming process was fun and pulling all nighters animating was a blast. My girlfirend almost dumped me because of how obsessed I was becoming but I completed and even got two awards. One of the best experences of my college career.</td>
    <td>After completing These Games I realized I should probably get a professional credit for my resume, as well. I applied for MU's Mizzou Student Media, and got it. I was assigned to make animations for the school's paper, television channel, and promos for the radio show. It was a lot of fun. This is one of my most recent promotions for the school's homecoming game of 2018. I made a lot of revisions but after a couple days they seamed to like it. Constuctive criticism is just that. Criticism to make you move in a more constructive way. I was glad I took that job because even though I wasn't paid, I did revieve the lesson of humility. Even though a couple of my nimations were shown in Erope, I still have room to improve.</td>
