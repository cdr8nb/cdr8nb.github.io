    <td>Chip Gubera, my 1610 Graphic Design instructor, gave the class his raw film and audio and told us to compile a trailer for his movie, Joplin Missouri, A Tornado Story. My professor is a midwest native and wanted to release a movie about the tradgey the people of Joplin went through in 2011. So for an early assignment, Proffesor Gubera assigned the class in putting together the video, audio, and music to make a trailer which had a clear mood of tradgedy. I think I did a good job but could have dedicated a little more time in the music. I learned that working within the contraints of copyrights was a tough and tedious process.</td>
    <td>I always wondered how to make cool, tecturized backgrounds and silhouettes in my videos. My first animating mentor, Joseph Erb, taught me a few tricks about blend modes but in my 3640 Graphics Design course was when I learned all of After Effect's blend modes. How to layer compositions and pictures and videos to make a thematic "skin" of sorts. In my 3640 Graphic Design class I learned how to blend compositions and utilize different modes to capture any look I wanted.</td>
    <td>This video was another assignment which I had to learn about masks in After Effects. How to blur or sharpen them, make them transparent or exact, and use them to subtract or add it's layer. I realized how many of the thumbnails I see on Youtube utilize masks and how it could create for a cool poster or make a professional news shot more convincing. My professor also taught the class how to use a cool effect which can act as a greenscreen. It was awesome.</td>
    <td>The spinning knife assignemnt was a competition to see who could make a throwing knife blend into a video of a warewolf with a knife in its head convincing. I think I did well but could never find a clean sound bite of a knife spinning through the air for three seconds. I have a mp3 of a knife squashing into the warewolf and its howl, but without the knife sound effect, it's better to have no sound at all. As digital stroytellers, I have to make sure that when I tell a narrative that is be convincing, intertaining, and effective. Sometimes I need to make hard decisions to do so.</td>
