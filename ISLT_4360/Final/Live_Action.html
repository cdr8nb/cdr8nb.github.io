    <td>My 1610 Graphic Design professor, Chip Gubera, is a Midwest native and wanted to release a movie about the tragedy the people of Joplin went through in 2011. So, for an early assignment, Professor Gubera assigned the class to create a trailer from raw footage of his Joplin Missouri, A Tornado Story film. He instructed us compile the video, audio, and music for a trailer which had a clear mood of tragedy. I made sure to create music with the non-copyright file he provided and make sure it was clean and clear. In hindsight, I could have given a couple more hours going through the music folder and putting together a better track. I learned that working within the constraints of copyrights was a tough and tedious process because you can’t just edit together songs, but have to create them from five second clips.</td>
    <td>Since my first animation course in spring of 2016, I always wondered how to make cool, texturized backgrounds and silhouettes in my videos. My first animating teacher, Joseph Erb, would wow the class with cool tricks to making professional looking animations. He would stress a story but we as creators can tell it any way we want to. It was intimidating at first, but after some time, addictive. Professor Erb taught me a few tricks about blend modes and interpreting footage but in my 3640 Graphics Design course was when I learned all of After Effect's blend modes. Through trial and error, I learned how to layer compositions and pictures and videos to make a thematic "skin" of sorts. I discovered how to put two videos on top of each other and see the most crucial parts in them. It was so fun. I learned how to blend compositions and utilize different modes to capture any look I wanted.</td>
    <td>For this video, my class was assigned to edit together a video that made sense. I did that but always noticed how good television shows use very slight pans and zooms to convey how characters are feeling. Like in Breaking Bad when Skyler called the police about her “missing” husband while the camera swung around to reveal he was in the same room as her. Well I wanted to make sure to frame my actress as if she is boxed in. So, I made sure that in most of her shots, she appeared with a rectangular object around her or just that there were rectangular or square objects in frame. But I didn’t only want her to feel boxed in, but suffocating. I zoomed in, a lot, to convey the point that she feels as if her world is so small.</td>
    <td>I loved editing together this film because there were three acts and lots of motion going on in each of them. The biggest hurtle I had to overcome was knowing how long to keep a shot going. I want this to be professional so I don’t want a shot to go on forever, but I do not want to undermine the emotional significance. Also, we have to think of viewers and see the film though their eyes and ears. We don’t want to treat viewers like children with long drawn out shots but still give them the time to absorb the situation, the shot, and also even a little bit to find a personal connection.</td>
