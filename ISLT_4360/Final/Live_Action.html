    <td>My Graphic Design professor, Chip Gubera, is a Midwest native who released a movie about the tragedy the people of Joplin went through in 2011.  So, for an early assignment, Professor Gubera asked the class to create a trailer from raw footage of his Joplin Missouri, A Tornado Story film. He instructed us to compile the video, audio, and music for the trailer which had a clear mood of tragedy. I made sure to create music with the non-copyright file he provided and make sure the message was clear. I learned that working within the constraints of copyrights is a tough and detailed process because you can’t just edit together songs, but you must create them from five second clips.</td>
    <td>Since my first animation course in spring of 2016, I always wondered how to make texturized backgrounds and silhouettes in my videos. My first animation professor, Joseph Erb, would wow the class with cool tricks to making professional looking animations. He would stress every animation must have a story but we as creators can tell it any way we want to. It was intimidating at first, but after some time, it became addictive. Professor Erb taught me about blend modes and interpreting footage. In my 3640 Graphics Design course I learned all After Effect's blend modes. Through trial and error, I learned how to layer compositions and pictures and videos to make a thematic "skin" of sorts. I discovered how to put two videos on top of each other and see the most crucial parts in them. Ultimately, I learned how to blend compositions and utilize different modes to capture any look I wanted.</td>
    <td>For this video, my class was assigned to edit together a video that made sense. I did that but always noticed how great television shows use very slight pans and zooms to convey how characters are feeling. Like in Breaking Bad when Skyler called the police about her “missing” husband while the camera slowly swung around to reveal he was in the same room as her. Well I wanted to make sure to frame my actress as if she was boxed in. So, I made sure that in most of her shots, she appeared with a rectangular object around her or just that there were rectangular or square objects in frame. But I didn’t only want her to feel boxed in, but also suffocated. I zoomed in, a lot, to convey the point that she feels as if her world is so small.</td>
    <td>I loved editing this film because there were three acts and a lot of action going on in each of them. Not big action sets or fight scenes but many quick, subtle moments. The biggest hurdle I had to overcome was knowing how long to keep a shot going. I wanted this to be professional, so I did not want the shot to go on forever, but I do not want to undermine the emotional significance of the scene. We must think of viewers and see the film though their eyes and ears.  We don’t want to treat viewers like children with long drawn out shots but still give them the time to absorb the situation, the shot, and form a personal connection.</td>
