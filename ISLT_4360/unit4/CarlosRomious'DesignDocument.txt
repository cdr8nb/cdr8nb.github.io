Carlos Romious' Design Document
</h1>
<p>
<strong>Purpose</strong>
<blockquote>
This website will serve as a portfolio of my animations, live action work, audio and video editing, and graphic designs. This portfolio will showcase my work while I navigate you through my journey of digital storytelling. I will also provide my contact information for advice and employment. This website is a means to showcase both my ability and creativity but myself as a person.
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Use Cases</strong>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Those who venture onto my site will see recent work along with old works because at the first of the month, new work will be uploaded to this site.</strong> I love animating but I also like taking a camera out and capturing the contrast of the stormy clouds to the Midwest wheat fields. I am in a stage of my life where I have school assignments and a graphic design job but also like to create work just to experiment with technology and get into festivals. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>To contact me for questions or jobs or suggestions or anything, I will create and post a work email, Twitter, and YouTube page.</strong> I want to be able to be able to get my name out there as well as be easily contacted. 
<p>
<strong>For students who need to find some inspiration or incentive to get into digital storytelling, I will also upload tutorials of specific techniques.</strong>  I saw tutorials on one animator’s portfolio and it really inspired me. He made sure to walk through how he created something he used in a video and I have decided to adapt that. My graphics design teacher used to give lectures, but for those who missed a class our two he would record his screen and walk his way through important techniques. I found this to be very useful and will also provide a tutorial section on my site.

<strong>Design Concept</strong> 
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Audience:</strong> The target audience of my website will most likely be high school to college students looking for inspiration, cool animation and design techniques, and just a word of advice if they need one. Also, employers who need visual jobs done in a specific amount of time to stumble upon my page and check out what my abilities and styles are. They would have to realize that I plan to work from home but I will travel with my equipment and met all deadlines. I know I will be moving from one place to another, so freelance employers are the employers I want to attract. And lastly, I expect my friends and family to look at my website. I want to show off how far I have come and what I plan to do.

<li>
I love <a href="https://brickvisual.com/projects/animation/">Brick Visuals</a> homepage because they look so clean and nice while also promoting their employers. They showcase their past work and their services as well as their employers as real people. 
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://jasonshum.com/animation-tutorials/">Jason Shum Animation Portfolio</a> is a great example of barebone. It is clean and from the homepage you can see everything you need. I like that but a little more like in the homepage would probably be livelier.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.davidairey.co.uk">David Airey Portfolio</a> is definitely cool and sleek but there seems to be a little too much going on. The background is fading in and out and in the pages,  there is very little white space.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.pixar.com">Pixar's</a> website is cool because it is current with a beautifully rendered Incredibles 2 picture on the homepage. The rest of the website looks pretty basic but I’m starting to realize that most homepages are simple. They just show one cool thing and are basic and direct at the options on the page. I think I’m going to use Pixar’s website as my main inspiration.
</li>
<li>
Now I know why the professionals make their site’s simple. On <a href="https://www.freelanced.com/shanekillian">Freelanced's</a> homepage, the owner has a picture of himself, friends page, employee’s page, jobs he’ll do, about him page, a portfolio page, a blog, his hourly rate, a rating system, and an annoying purple background. This cements it. I want a plain website which is clear and has one cool visual or animation or camera shot. It is better to look bland and professional than eccentric and novice. I might even not date my work, on my website. Viewers can always see the date on my YouTube posts but this guy’s site looks like he had a lot of motivation and equipment once and now hasn’t poster worked for 30 days. He even has a thing that shows how many people have liked his Facebook page and it has a 0 about the thumbs up sign. There really is a truth in an attraction to mystery. And I might have to take that to heart. Even youtubers and comedians and shows I like take time to tell the story. They don’t just tell who they are and their motivations and what their family is like on the first video, stand up set, or on the homepage. This might sound really strange but what I am saying is I want there to be mystery in my website. I do not need too many dates and opinions and this and that on my website. In my content I can get into that but not on the website, and specifically not on the homepage.

<strong>Presentation Information</strong>
</p> 
<blockquote>
Content is going to mainly be pdfs and mp4 videos. I will use pdfs to showcase graphic designs and mp4s for animations, live actions, and tutorials. 
Content synopsis will be pages of videos or images on the left with descriptions of them on the right.

<p>
<strong>Wireframe</strong> of website is as presented below
</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="https://wireframe.cc/8tcPUP">My Webpage Layout</a> Or I can do it this way in where the background is the video and it feels more three dimensional. Also, it shows a knowledge and attentiveness to web design. It would appear as the Pixar homepage. I do not know if this is plagiarism though https://www.pixar.com. 
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Rational for organization</strong> is that I want this website to look simple, clean, professional, but also fun. So, I believe I am pretty sure my layout of a white theme, one title with three pages and three contact links would be best. Also, a quick fun video that fades into a still shot would provide a little sample and give the homepage some life while settling on the professional calm atmosphere. I do not want to appear as guy who is testing out his skills on his website and add goofy colors or strange fonts or any fat to my site. I want this site, and especially the homepage, to say, “this is what Carlos can do, and he is available to help you, educationally or professionally.”
<p>
<strong>Media</strong> will be my own videos and images. I will have to make some music with non-copywritten sounds I received from my graphics design class and probably buy music, for future projects.
</p>
My <strong><a href="https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/68012">color scheme</a></strong> is going to go professional and boring. It consists of three different shades of black, red and white. I most likely will use the white, red, and only two of the shades of the black.

<strong>Data Collection</strong>	
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
My target audience is freelance employers and students looking for help, so I want to 
appear as professional while also letting my style of digital storytelling show. They both would venture onto my site just to get a vibe of what I am capable of and if my quality meets their expectations. 
</p>
<p>
I am guessing employers and students would not be using my website often. It is like a resume. They will just look around to see what quality I am working at. Thinking about it, they probably won’t read the work descriptions. They just want to scroll through to see my quality and style and find my contact information. 	
</p>	
<p>
The most interest content my audience would look for and at is my work media, contact links, and maybe experience. But experience might blow up my whole image of mystery and also, I have only worked for one organization indefinitely so I probably should not include experience. I just thought about putting accomplishments such as my laurels, and diplomas and stuff in the background of the animation and live action pages. So viewers can learn about what stuff I have accomplished but I do not have to list out my work experience.
