The Portfolio of Carlos Romious
</h1>
<p>
Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Carlos Romious and I am a senior in the University of Missouri’s school of Digital Storytelling. On this page I am showcasing my animations, storyboards, and graphic designs. On my webpage you can scroll through my work, see what I am currently working on, and get to know me as well. I hope you enjoy what you see.

My About Page
</h2>
<p>
Hello, all! My name is Carlos Romious and I am coming close to graduating the University of Missouri with a degree in digital storytelling. I started college looking for an engineering degree, following in the footsteps of my mom, but decided to pursue a more creative route. After researching the field, consulting with a few trusted mentors, and a week of self-reflection I decided to take my first intro to digital storytelling class in fall semester of 2016.

<p>
Since the fall of 2015 I have been 
</p>
<ul>
<li>camera-manning on scenes </li>
<li>recording and mixing audio clips </li>
<li>designing posters </li> 
<li>cutting trailers </li> 
<li>lighting sets</li> 
<li>voice acting</li> 
<li>and (my favorite) ANIMATING!!</li> 
</ul>
<p>
I have loved animating since the first walk cycle I produced. My professor was so passionate and inspired me to animate whatever comes to mind.

“Honey, let me tell you something: I’ve struggled long and hard to get where I am. Take a look at my face. You don’t win people on beauty with this face and the only reason I have gotten to where I am is everything I put on the air I believe in a hundred percent. I’ll bust my balls, do something, and throw it out if it sucks because I will not rip my audience off.” Howard Stern

<p>
About a half a year ago I won two animation competitions and now work for my school to promote sports and fun campus activities. Brand images, motion graphics, posters, editing. I have done it all. Let me know if you’d be 
interested in me doing it for you too.

I am going to start a monthly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAgG04VskKyj02qeRKTFEjg/featured?view_as=subscriber">YouTube</a> animation schedule so look out for that. Also, my <a href="https://twitter.com/cjromious1">twitter</a> will be boring but I will try to inform those who are watching of when I am in the country and working. And my <a href="mailto:cdr8nb@mail.missouri.edu">email</a> is the best way to directly get to me.
