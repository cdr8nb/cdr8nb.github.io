Evaluation Report
</h1>
<blockquote>
<h3>
Evaluator
</h3>
<p>
So, my evaluator was my girlfriend, Leonie. She ran my site on her phone and complained to me that it wasn’t working. I was asleep during that time and she eventually tried the site on her laptop with a PC computer. She prefers google chrome and uses Wi-Fi exclusively. 
</p>
<h3>
Evaluation
</h3>
<p>
She gave my site an 80% for design. She really liked that the links all worked and all have a clear purpose but the site and media took time to load.
</p>
<p>
She then gave my site an 83% for the content. She thought all the pages had clear and stimulating content which was all accurate but gave me a 1/5 for links to being up to date. Maybe this is because I didn’t change my “last updated” date in the footer. 
</p>
<p>
She lastly gave a 93% for my site’s creditability. She only complained about information regarding author and credentials and material being original, and including citations with no copyright infringements. I will have to ask her more about that. Maybe I need to explain the animations and live actions like how I did for my graphic designs.
</p>
<h3>
Summary
</h3>
<p>
I need to ask my girlfriend more about what she didn’t like about the site and. Make the appropriate changes. Obviously, I need to focus on the design and work my way to the creditability. I want this site to be easy to get through and fun. I know people will be on it for less than 4 minutes so I want everything to be perfect. I think that my site has achieved my cases but I should have an "About Me" or "Mission Statement" page or something so people understand my site is more than just a portfolio but a place to learn and a way to contact me and get advice.
